# instant-everything
Removes the annoying animation and skips the progress bar for enchanting, upgrading, soulbinding, dismantling, and merging items.

Each mode can be toggled by using the in-game command `instant [mode]`, with `[mode]` being `enchant`, `upgrade`, `soulbind`, `merge`, or `dismantle`.
